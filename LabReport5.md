# Lab Report 5
## Completing grade.sh (Lab 6)
### My Progress 
I decided to do this lab about grade.sh because I did not finish it the first time around. I was pretty confused in some parts
and I definitely got stuck with a similar problem that was shown in lab 8 where JUnit was not being found. Also I had to find ways
into caculating the score of the test and trying to find the tests that did pass. Overall I understand more now how to do a bash
script and I feel like a TA now.

### Running Some Tests:
